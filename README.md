# asv [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/asv.svg?style=flat)](http://badge.fury.io/js/asv)

 [Electron / Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/electron) version manager

## Installation

    $ npm install -g asv

or

    $ git clone git://github.com/omnidan/asv.git && cd asv && make install

### Quickstart
    $ asv latest
    $ atoms

Alternatively, you can use the `electron` command instead of `atoms`:

    $ electron

And, of course, you can launch apps with it:

    $ electron path/to/electron/app/
    $ electron electron_app.asar

### Installing Binaries

Install a few versions, the version given becomes the active electron/atom-shell binary once installation is complete.

    $ asv 0.20.5
    $ asv 0.20.4

Run `atoms` to run the selected version of electron/atom-shell.

List installed binaries:

    $ asv

      0.20.3
    Î¿ 0.20.4
      0.20.5

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ asv latest

Use or install the stable official release (_Note: Right now there is no stable version of electron, this will use the latest release_):

    $ asv stable

Install a custom or patched version of electron/atom-shell from a zipball:

    $ asv custom 0.20.5-me https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/zipball/v0.20.5

Install a version of electron/atom-shell from source:

    $ asv 0.20.5 source

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ asv rm 0.20.5 0.20.4 0.20.3

_Note that you cannot remove the actively running version. Change to a different version before removing._

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of electron/atom-shell, we can target
them directly by asking `asv` for the binary path:

    $ asv bin 0.20.5
    /usr/local/asv/versions/0.20.5/bin/

Start up electron/atom-shell 0.20.5 regardless of the active version:

    $ asv use 0.20.5

When installing or changing the active version we might want to run custom scripts:

    $ asv pre install /path/to/my/script
    $ asv post install /path/to/script
    $ asv pre change /path/to/my/script
    $ asv post change /path/to/script

Multiple scripts may be added for any event. To add two `pre change` scripts:

    $ asv pre change /path/to/script1
    $ asv pre change /path/to/script2

Scripts are executed in the order they were added.

List all pre change hooks:

    $ asv pre change

    /path/to/script1
    /path/to/script2

List all post install hooks:

    $ asv post install

    /path/to/scriptA
    /path/to/scriptB
    /path/to/scriptC

To remove a post install hook:

    $ asv post install rm /path/to/scriptB

Remove all post install hooks:

    $ asv post install rm

## Automatically keeping electron / atom-shell up-to-date
In order to automatically keep electron / atom-shell up-to-date, run `asv -y latest` in a cronjob.

Passing `-y` will skip the question asv asks you when installing a new version.

## Does this work with electron AND atom-shell?
Yes, `asv` checks the version string you passed, for versions <=0.23.0, atom-shell is downloaded and installed instead of electron, for newer versions, electron is downloaded and installed.

The command `atoms` works just like before. There is also an `electron` command, which is an alias to `atoms`.

Everything else should work just like nothing happened. If you do run into an issue, first make sure you have the latest `asv` version (>=1.1) installed, or update `asv` by running `npm install -g asv` - if it still doesn't work, please report your issue [on github](https://github.com/omnidan/asv/issues), it could be related to the fact that atom-shell was renamed to electron.

## Details

 `asv` by default installs electron/atom-shell to _/usr/local/asv/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of electron/atom-shell when `asv <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated electron/atom-shell versions are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which may be altered via the __ASV_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `asv` operates simply export __ASV_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
