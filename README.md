# asv

 [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) version manager

## Installation

    $ npm install -g asv

or

    $ git clone git://github.com/omnidan/asv.git && cd asv && make install

### Installing Binaries

Install a few versions, the version given becomes the active atom-shell binary once installation is complete.

    $ asv 0.20.5
    $ asv 0.20.4

List installed binaries:

    $ asv

      0.20.3
    Î¿ 0.20.4
      0.20.5

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ asv latest

Use or install the stable official release (_Note: Right now there is no stable version of atom-shell, this will use the latest release_):

    $ asv stable

Install a custom or patched version of atom-shell from a tarball:

    $ asv custom 0.20.5-me https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/tarball/v0.20.5
    
Install a version of atom-shell from source (_Note: This is not available at the moment_):

    $ asv 0.20.5 source

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ asv rm 0.20.5 0.20.4 0.20.3

_Note that you cannot remove the actively running version. Change to a different version before removing._

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of atom-shell, we can target
them directly by asking `asv` for the binary path:

    $ asv bin 0.20.5
    /usr/local/asv/versions/0.20.5/bin/
    
Start up atom-shell 0.20.5 regardless of the active version:

    $ asv use 0.20.5

When installing or changing the active version we might want to run custom scripts:

    $ asv pre install /path/to/my/script
    $ asv post install /path/to/script
    $ asv pre change /path/to/my/script
    $ asv post change /path/to/script
    
Multiple scripts may be added for any event. To add two `pre change` scripts:

    $ asv pre change /path/to/script1
    $ asv pre change /path/to/script2
    
Scripts are executed in the order they were added.
    
List all pre change hooks:

    $ asv pre change
    
    /path/to/script1
    /path/to/script2
    
List all post install hooks:

    $ asv post install
    
    /path/to/scriptA
    /path/to/scriptB
    /path/to/scriptC
    
To remove a post install hook:

    $ asv post install rm /path/to/scriptB
    
Remove all post install hooks:

    $ asv post install rm

## Details

 `asv` by default installs atom-shell to _/usr/local/asv/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of atom-shell when `asv <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated atom-shell versions are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which may be altered via the __ASV_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `asv` operates simply export __ASV_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
